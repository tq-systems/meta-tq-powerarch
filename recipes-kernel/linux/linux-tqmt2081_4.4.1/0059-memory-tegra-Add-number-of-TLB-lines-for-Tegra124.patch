Subject: [PATCH] memory/tegra: Add number of TLB lines for Tegra124

Tegra124 was accidentally left out when the number of TLB lines was
parameterized in commit 11cec15bf3fb ("iommu/tegra-smmu: Parameterize
number of TLB lines"). Fortunately this doesn't cause any noticeable
regressions upstream, presumably because there aren't any use-cases
that exercise enough pressure on the SMMU. But it is a regression
nonetheless, so let's fix it.

Fixes: 11cec15bf3fb ("iommu/tegra-smmu: Parameterize number of TLB lines")
